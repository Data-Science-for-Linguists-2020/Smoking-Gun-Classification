**Progress Report #1**:<br>
*February 4th, 2019*

This week, I finished polishing up my ideas for my project. I started my GitHub repository and filled the README, project-ideas, and progress-report files.
I also gathered details about the history and organization of the dataset, as well as a list of relevant resources for visitors to my project.
