**Progress Report #1**:<br>
*February 4th, 2020*

*Brief*: This week, I finished polishing up my ideas for my project. I started my GitHub repository and filled the README, project-ideas, and progress-report files.
I also gathered details about the history and organization of the dataset, as well as a list of relevant resources for visitors to my project.

**Progress Report #2**<br>
*March 16th, 2020*

*Brief*: As of today, my big accomplishment is making a function that can create DataFrames given a user and a range of emails in the all_documents folder to check.
That being said, this is relatively buggy and it also has many flaws as I pointed out. I have a nice little summary (#3) in my notebook. I'm going to try to take steps
to fix these problems and make the algorithm work on a larger portion of my dataset, but this is a step forward to work off of. Going to definitely need advice
for my EDA phase though.

*Sharing Data*: I'll be sharing one of the user's(cash-m) email directory, as well as linking the original source for where I downloaded the corpora. I picked this user as it
is a prototypical file directory for the rest of the corpus. This certainly falls under fair use, but I'm hesitant to release any more because Cohen (the professor) whose website
I downloaded the corpus from) did not specify a license. In short, I gave visitors a slice of the cake and a link to the cake shop.

*License*: This project will be licensed under the MIT License. I want a simple and open-sourced license that allows users to add onto my finished product.
