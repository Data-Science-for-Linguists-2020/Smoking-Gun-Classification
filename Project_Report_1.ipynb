    "**Report Brief**<br>\n",
    "In this progress report, I'm hoping to do as much of the data processing as I can, although I don't expect to finish. The breakdown of my project likely means that the heaviest proportion of work will fall on data cleaning/organization, and then EDA, with visualization and analysis being the least intensive section. This is because my project is product-centric--first and foremost, I'm trying to make a *thing* that can classify data.\n",
    "___\n",
    "**Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a list of things I'm hoping to accomplish in the first portion of my project:\n",
    "1. ~Fix the Markdown formatting for my README and other files~\n",
    "2. ~Add data sample to GitHub~\n",
    "3. read in data from different folders/sources **unsuccessful**\n",
    "4. create a sample DF with a few columns of useful data \n",
    "    1. text\n",
    "    2. folder it is in\n",
    "    3. length of email\n",
    "    4. to/from\n",
    "5. visualize some of the data with a few statistical tests or plots\n",
    "\n",
    "B and D will likely be fairly difficult, and just reading in the data isn't easy, so I'm really aiming to accomplish 1, 2, 3, and 4. Lets see how it goes!\n",
    "___\n",
    "**Sharing Data**<br>\n",
    "In regards to sharing data, there is a bit of a problem in that the source from which I took my data (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) doesn't make mention of any type of licensing. I'm going to need to look into this further, but I'm tentatively planning on my data sample being just one (anonymized) person's emails, since this is the most natural data member of the corpus. This will clearly demonstrate the shape and scope of the corpus without taking up too much space or compromising privacy."

    "**What Went Well**:<br>\n",
    "1. Outside the immediate bounds of this notebook, I've definitely improved my ability to use Markdown. I definitely think my notebooks and README's look a lot better.\n",
    "2. Searching through the directory. At the beginning of this notebook, I did test the opening and reading in of mqny different files from the directory. This may not be important *this minute*, but the ability to apply my cleaning, exploration, and analysis to all parts of this corpus cannot be understated.\n",
    "3. I have a clear direction going forward. Truthfully, this notebook was a huge failure and I did not prepare for how difficult it would be to do simple tasks like reading in data. That being said, I have a much clearer idea of what I need moving forward into Spring Break.\n",
    "___\n",
    "**What Went Poorly**:\n",
    "1. I really struggled in converting data types in the wild. Reading the data in, getting the data into a tuple, and transferring this data into a dataframe were all difficult/impossible for me in this notebook. See section below.\n",
    "2. I wasn't thinking ahead. You could probably tell by 5-6 cells in that I wasn't going to make it for the long haul in this one. It's *incredibly important* to make sure when you are reading newly formatted data that you put it into the correct data type (namely, my problems with the tuples).\n",
    "___\n",
    "**What's Next**:\n",
    "1. A list of things I need to fix from this notebook:\n",
    "    1. A generalizable way to turn the heading section into a tuple with the category and the data. I was close here, but the emails with multiple lines per category (i.e. an email sent to 30 people) tripped me up here.\n",
    "    2. A better text string. This is one I need to think about more. I'm definitely going to need something to put into the dataframe, as far as the body of the email is concerned. The question is, what should I use? My current version needs fixing.\n",
    "    3. A DF. This one will come last, but I definitely need a DF that can be expanded to include N number of emails.\n",
    "___ \n",
    "**Conclusion**:<br>\n",
    "All in all, a very rough go of things. After midterms this week I'll be able to pour more time into this project, which is what I need. I definitely struggle with goal setting on individually driven projects, which is something I'll need to work on."
